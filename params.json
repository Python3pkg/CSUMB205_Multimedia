{"name":"CSUMB 205 - Image Class","tagline":"A wrapper class for PIL's Image class for academic purposes","body":"# CSU Monterey Bay CST205\r\n\r\n## Simple Multimedia Classes\r\n\r\n### Current Version: v0.8.4\r\n\r\nThis project offers students access to a simple rgbImage class, which is built on the use of the Image module in the PIL package. As PIL is no longer updated for Python 3, this package relies on Pillow.\r\n\r\nThis package assumes that the user is using at least Python 3.4.\r\n\r\n**If you have not installed Python 3.4.2, please download it from** [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\r\n\r\n*If you are using Windows*, make sure to check the option to *add the* **python.exe** *to your path*. PIP will not work otherwise.\r\n\r\nWindows 8 users will also need to download and install the [numpy package](http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.9.1/numpy-1.9.1-win32-superpack-python3.4.exe/download) manually from the link given.\r\n\r\n***\r\n## INSTALLATION\r\nYou can download this package through the use of PIP, a built-in package installer that comes with Python 3.4.2. Go to the start menu and open an administrator command prompt. Then run...\r\n\r\n     pip install csumb205-multimedia\r\n\r\nOn Mac OSX, you will have multiple versions of Python. You *still* need to install Python 3.4.2, but you will open Terminal, and type the command...\r\n\r\n     pip3 install csumb205-multimedia\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n## USAGE:\r\nThe interface is designed to let you modify pixel values of an image. To start, open the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that came with your installation of Python, **IDLE**.\r\n\r\nOnce you have started the application, you will be greeted with the Python Shell. Each line will start with `>>>`, which is the Python command prompt (similar to `$ ` on Mac and `C:\\> ` on Windows). To make sure that you have correctly installed the package through use of PIP, type this command... (again, do not copy in the `>>>`)\r\n\r\n     >>> from imageClass import rgbImage\r\n\r\nNow you can start creating Python scripts. You can also keep playing around with the package in the Python Shell, which is what the rest of the directions assume. If you wish to save all of these commands in a Python file (extension is .py) that can be executed in it's entirety, go to File, then New File, and start writing these commands in the new window.\r\n\r\nThis is how you actually create an Image object.\r\n\r\n     >>> myImage = rgbImage(\"/absolute/path/to/your/image\")\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: If you leave the constructor empty, tkinter will open a file dialog, asking you to choose a file.\r\n\r\n     >>> myImage = rgbImage(\"\")  ===>  tkinter filedialog GUI\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that we have our image imported, and stored in the object myImage, we can get the width and heigh individually...\r\n\r\n     >>> myWidth = myImage.width\r\n     >>> myHeight = myImage.height\r\n\r\n...and so much more. The most important part of our image, however, is the list of pixels. There are two ways to get individual pixels. We can get individual pixels by using two array references, where the first value is the row the pixel is in, or Y-coordinate (starting from 0), and the second is the column the pixel is in, or X-coordinate (starting from 0).\r\n\r\n     >>> a_pixel = myImage.pixels[0][0]\r\n\r\nWe can also use one of the object's functions, `getPixel()`, to get an individual pixel. The upside of using this function is that it will check that the values you pass are within the bounds of the picture. If not, it raises an error.\r\n\r\nThis function takes two integers. The two possible ways to get a pixel, given a coordinate, are shown below...\r\n\r\n     >>> a_pixel = myImage.getPixel(1, 6)\r\n               or\r\n     >>> a_pixel = myImage.getPixel( (4,9) )\r\n\r\nThe difference is that the first one passes each coordinate to the function individually, while the second passes them as a tuple, which an immutable array that can be created in Python with the `()` characters around a list of values. This was mainly implemented in case it made more sense to pass something that looks like a coordinate pair.\r\n\r\nWe can also get every pixel in the picture in a sequence using the `getAllPixels()` function. This will return an array containing every pixels in the picture, which could then be iterated through.\r\n\r\nEach pixel is represented by an `rgbPixel` object. These objects have a \"red\", \"green\", and \"blue\" attribute, which are integers. We can then loop through every pixels and set it's green, blue or red values as we see fit.\r\n\r\n      >>> for row in myImage.getAllPixels:\r\n      ...    for pixel in row:\r\n      ...        pixel.setRed(255)\r\n      ...        pixel.setBlue(0)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a pixel's attribute is set to anything above 255 or below 0, the object will automatically wrap the value around until the number is between 0 and 255. For example, setting a pixel's red value to 300 will actually set it to 300-256, or 44.\r\n\r\n      >>> myImage.getPixel(0,0).setRed(300)  ===>  the pixel in myImage at (0,0) red is now 44\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more detailed information on the `rgbImage` class and the `rgbPixel` class, type `help('simpleImage.ImageClass')` in the Python Shell, or check out [this text file](./moduleHelp.txt) for a printout of the previous command.\r\n\r\n***\r\n### PyPI:\r\nThe Python Package Index page for this package can be [found here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/csumb205-multimedia).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
