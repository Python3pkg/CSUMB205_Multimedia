{"name":"CSUMB 205 - Image Class","tagline":"A wrapper class for PIL's Image class for academic purposes","body":"CSUMB's CST205 - A simple Image Class\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nThis project offers students acces to a simple RGBImage class, which\r\nis built on the use of the Image module in the PIL package. As PIL is no\r\nlonger updated for Python 3, this package relies on Pillow.\r\n\r\nThis package will assume that the user is using at least Python 3.4\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can download this package through the use of PIP. Make sure that you have \"pip\" installed (comes with an install of Python 3.4.2), and from the command line, run\r\n***\r\n`pip install CSUMB205-Image`\r\n***\r\n\r\nOn Mac OSX, you will have multiple versions of Python. You still need to install Python 3.4.2, but when you run pip, you must use\r\n***\r\n`pip3 install CSUMB205-Image`\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe Python Package Index page for this package can be [found here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/CSUMB205-Image).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
