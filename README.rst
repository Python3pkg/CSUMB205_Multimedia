CSUMB's CST205 - A simple Image Class
=======================

This project offers students acces to a simple RGBImage class, which
is built on the use of the Image module in the PIL package. As PIL is no
longer updated for Python 3, this package relies on Pillow.

This package will assume that the user is using at least Python 3.4
